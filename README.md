# Smart Antennas Framework


## This project incorporates common algorithms and state-of-the-art implementations of MIMO communications systems, Array Signal Processing and DoA Estimation techniques.

The project folder has substructes and the respective code is divided in 6 directories for each language. The code has implementations in Python, Matlab, Julia, C++, and C.

Common basic routines are located in core, plotting routines and methods like optimization algorithms are located in utils. The respective implementations are in the named subdirectories. For orientation look at sub file name and the suffix of the file (e.g. pr_dml.py or omp.cpp)
